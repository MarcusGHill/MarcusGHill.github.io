Now it's time for eventListeners.

So in our HTLM we got this button
{% highlight ruby %}
<button id="button">Click Here</button>
 {% endhighlight %}

 ___

 we want to listen if the user clicks on it and execute a function if the button gets clicked
 inside the parenthesis of eventListener the first parameter is what event to listen for and the second is what to do if that event is detected.
 in this case, run the function "youClicked".
 {% highlight ruby %}
let buttonClicked = document.querySelector(#button).eventListener('click', youClicked)

function youClicked(){
    /*code for what you want to happen when button is clicked*/Â¨
  console.log('you clicked my button')
}
 {% endhighlight %}
 ___

Adding event parameter. The name can be whatever but is usualy event or e.
{% highlight ruby %}
function youClicked(e){
    /*will give us the full button tag declared above*/
console.log(e.target)

/*returns button witch is the id of the button*/
console.log(e.target.id)

/*returns whatever type of event is being listened for in this case click*/
console.log(e.type)

/*find postion of the mouse, x and y axis, relative to the window*/
console.log(e.clientX)
console.log(e.clientY)

/*find postion of the mouse, x and y axis, relative to the object getting clicked, in this case button*/
console.log(e.offsetX)
console.log(e.offsetY)

/*findout if spedific key is held down while click, returns true if it is and false if it's not*/
console.log(e.altKey)
console.log(e.shiftKey)
console.log(e.ctrlKey)

}
 {% endhighlight %}
