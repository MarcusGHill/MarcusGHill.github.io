My name is Marcus, I'm 29 years old and live in Borl√§nge. I have been wanting to start coding for years but being swamped in work from my startup I could not find the time. 

Since late 2018 I'm a free man again thus I can finaly focus on coding, and so far I absolutley love it. 
I work a fulltime job doing the nightshifts at a hotel and I'm very lucky to be able to code by my self all night.

I like trying to be as effective as possible and thats why I will try to kill two birds with one stone while making this site. I will create a tutorial of what I'm learning as to help me learn faster and better. How ever the tutorial will be based on my current knowledge and might therefore be hard for anyone else to follow.
